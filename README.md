## ðŸ“š Project Description
In this project, I developed an application to manage a shopping cart for a fictional coffee shop, with the following functionalities:

- List of products (coffees) available for purchase
- Add a specific amount of items to the cart
- Increase or remove the amount of items in the cart
- Form for the user to fill in his address
- Display the total items in the cart in the Header
- Display the total value of the sum of items in the cart multiplied by the value
